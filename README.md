# Must haves
* [X] Users are able to add a new event by clicking "Add New Event" button at the top, then fill out the input fields with its name, start, end dates, and then save it.

* [X] Page should get the initial data from the server during the first loading. (i.e. data should persist after refresh)

* [X] Users are able to remove the event by clicking the delete button

* [X] Users are able to edit the event by clicking the edit icon, and click the save icon again to save it


# Nice to haves:
* [X] Users can click the cancel button to cancel add. 
There is a bug on cancel edit button

* [ ] Implement input validation

* [ ] Users can edit multiple elements at once, removing or editing one element won't affect other elements

* [X] Clear inputs after creating an event

* [ ] Make the style as close to the demo as possible, make it responsive
